# Uploading New Documents
Each repository that you use should have its own subfolder, such as "google-scholar" or "pub-med". 

Each document must be placed in the subfolder of the repository where it was found. 

If such a folder does not exist yet, please create one.

# Data Formats
The following formats are preferred, in descending order:
1. XML or other strongly structured markup
2. HTML or other semi-structured data
3. Plain text
4. PDF
5. Images, scans and other visual representations
