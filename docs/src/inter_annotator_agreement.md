# Inter-Annotator Agreement
For all annotation layers, the agreement between multiple annotators will be measured on a small sample of the dataset.

## Exceptions
Some layers will not be part of the agreement evaluation:
- The position of the [answers](schemas/answer.md) in the [context](schemas/context.md) layer is chosen randomly and, therefore, cannot be compared reasonably.
