# Data Formats
The following formats are preferred, in descending order:
1. XML or other strongly structured markup
2. HTML or other semi-structured data
3. Plain text

PDFs, images, scans and other visual representations will be discarded, with few to no exceptions. The reasoning is that the necessary amount of preprocessing for such formats would be large and lead to inconsistencies in the dataset.
