# Annotation Platform
We use version 22.1 of the annotation tool [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/) (Klie et al., 2018), hosted on internal servers at [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/). The annotation platform is password-protected, but all annotations will be made publicly available in this repository.
## Data Import
Inception is able to import plain text data from .txt files where each segment is on a new line and tokens are separated by a single whitespace.
## Data Export
### Data Format
Annotations are exported to XML files based on the [UIMA CAS XMI](https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.xmi) specification.
### Standoff Annotations
Additional layers and their annotations are serialized in a standoff manner, i.e., with references to their respective base layer (such as IDs of tokens or segments).
