# Curation Principles
## Annotation Complexity
In most cases (about 80% of the dataset), we aim for well-known, simple and intuitive annotations. The remaining parts (about 20% of the dataset) should consist of rare and complex cases that are more difficult to annotate. Our hypothesis is that these are harder to learn for automatic classifiers and can be used for more advanced evaluations.
