# Sample Documents and Selection Criteria
## Domains and Registers
Our dataset is a multi-domain, multi-register collection of German documents about COVID-19. We want to include texts from different backgrounds, such as Twitter, laws, administration and science. We are aware that this heterogeneity introduces a lot of challenges for the annotation process. Nevertheless, we believe it to be a worthwhile effort for training more general and more robust models that do not overfit to a single domain or register.
