# Token
The token layer points character indices in the [raw text layer](raw_text.md). It marks spans of characters as belonging to the same token using unique identifiers.

Other layers that directly reference this layer:
- [Named Entities](entity.md)
- [Credibility](credibility.md)
- [Political Bias](political_bias.md)
- [Question Answering](question_answering.md)
