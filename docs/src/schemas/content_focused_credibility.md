# Content-focused Credibility Pipeline

We create a topic or content-focused annotation pipeline with three annotation layers, to firm up the credibility annotations for our domain keeping the user-perspective on credibility as defined by others (see section Credibility Definition). 

The content-focused credibility pipeline includes three annotation layers in the following order:

(1)  [Informativeness](informativeness.md) - (2) [Topics](topic.md) - (3) [Credibility](credibility.md).  

## Credibility Definition
Following the definitions of Navok et al. and Gupta et al. we define credibility as the property of being trusted, i.e. a text is declared credible if a user, e.g. based on common sense, believes that the information it contains is to some extent credible [3,4]. 
Based on the hypothesis in Castillo et al., that there are signals available in the social media environment itself that enable users to assess information credibility, we explore the credibility only based on the information the content of a post is giving. In contrast to Castillo et al., we anonymize the usersâ€™ names to avoid gender and other biases that distract the annotators from the content.
